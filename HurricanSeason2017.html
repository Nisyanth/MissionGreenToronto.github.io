								<p>The 2017 hurricane season has been one to remember for fellow Americans. This year, more vicious, land-falling storms have developed than any of the past few years combined. Four of these colossal storms had escalated to Category 4-5 range. The U.S. has never been hit by three storms this strong in modern records.  
                                <br />
                                Hurricane Harvey landed over Southeast Texas and Southwest Louisiana on August 26th. A staggering 19 trillion gallons of rain wiped out the state of Texas, causing a huge flood to engulf many of the state’s residential homes and buildings. Texas Governor Greg Abbott estimated that Harvey will cost the state up to $180 billion, more than the devastating blow of Hurricane Katrina.  
                                <br />
                                Hurricane Irma is considered one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. While Irma had a consistent wind speed of 180 mph for 37 hours, it set a record for most intense storm for such a long duration on Earth. Irma touched down on September 10th, viciously assaulting the Florida Keys – a string of tropical islands stretching about 120 miles off the southern tip of the U.S. state of Florida – before terrorizing the Florida coasts.
                                <br />
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/img28.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hurricane Maria landed in Puerto Rico only 10 days after Irma, and was recorded as the strongest storm to hit the island since the 1928 San Felipe hurricane. It brought along winds over 100 mph and more than 30 in of rain. The entire island ended up losing power, and was put under flood warnings.
                                <br />
                                Over the four weeks from late August to, mid-September, the U.S. has experienced some of the most deadly hurricanes in history over close time intervals. This devastating hurricane season is also reminiscent of the 2005 season, when Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, both Category 5 storms, wiped out thousands of lives in North and Central America. A major influence towards the 2017 hurricane season may have been the increasing change in global climate. Gradually warming temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, consistent rising of sea levels, and increasing rainfall are all considered decisive factors in what led to both Hurricane Harvey and Irma. The potential increase in factors of climate change has led to a greatly demoralizing 2017 hurricane season.
