								<p>The Paris Agreement is a compromise designed by the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFC), marking a significant turning point in the battle against climate change. Leaders from all around the world teamed up in order to legally validate actions against pollution through the UNFC. However, the United States State Department has officially notified the UN that they will pull back from the Paris Agreement.
                                <br />
                                <span class="image left"><img src="images/img20.jpg" alt="" /></span>The United States of America, led by President Donald J. Trump decided on opposing the insistence of the EU and the Chinese government, who both cemented their commitment to the deal in thinking that the U.S. would also be in agreement as well. Trump stated that if he had agreed to the act, it would have cost America trillions of dollars, “killed” jobs, and delay the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries. Some of the most illustrious U.S. establishments, including Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook, all pleaded with Trump to stay in the agreement. Meanwhile, SpaceX, Tesla, and Paypal co-founder, Elon Musk, stated that he will leave Trump’s advisory councils due to the decision.   
                                <br />
                                Cosmologist and theoretical physicist, Stephen Hawking, has stated that the decision could be ‘catastrophic’, and can lead to everlasting damage to the climate. Hawking stated “Trump’s action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, raining sulphuric acid. It can also cause avoidable damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children”.
                                <br />
								Another study by The Climate Opinion showed that 47% of Trump supporters (minority) exemplified full support in the agreement. Although many fellow American citizens supported the Paris Climate Agreement, the UNSSD have<span class="image right"><img src="images/img21.jpg" alt="" /></span>  elected to back down from the act, concluding that it would likely cost America trillions of dollars, while also delaying any non-renewable industries.
